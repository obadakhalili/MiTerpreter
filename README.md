# MiTerpreter

Update of the old repository with the same name (MiTerpreter). I created the engine for my computer architecture class, and
at first, I used Vanilla JS for the frontend then upgraded it to VueJS using the CDN. And now I built the frontend using VueJS the framework (Vue-CLI) with Vuex as a store, as an exercise project after finishing the first half of the Fullstack VueJS book.

And [here's](https://github.com/obadakhalili/Fullstack-VueJS/) a repository that traces my journey in the mentioned book.
